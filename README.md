### Learning Goals

The learning goals for this project were to: 

- Write squeaky clean, well refactored code using ES6 syntax.
- Learn to pass information between components using props.
- Learn to write readable JSX.
- Use propTypes for every component receiving props.
- Learn how to unit test React components including snapshot testing, methods, and changes in state.
